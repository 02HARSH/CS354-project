This from the party of states  rights. Just yesterday, Spicer said that transgender students  rights are a states  rights issue. Coincidentally, the states that have legalized recreational marijuana use voted largely for Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton. Hmm Spicer just compared recreational marijuana to the opioid crisis after an Arkansas reporter asked whether alleged President Donald Trump was OK with the state s medical marijuana law, rules for which were recently approved by the state s Medical Marijuana Commission.Spicer said the Department of Justice will be  taking action  against states that have legalized recreational marijuana.Spicer: DOJ will be  taking action  against states that have legalized recreational marijuana.  Radley Balko (@radleybalko) February 23, 2017Then this happened:Spicer said Trump approves of medical marijuana use   which could help provide relief to the chronically ill   as opposed to recreational use, which Spicer suggested was tied to the opioid crisis many states are currently facing.Watch:  There is still a federal law that we need to abide by   when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature,  Spicer said.This is going down really well on Twitter.So let s break down @seanspicer today: He says states should have the right to decide trans bathroom use, but not recreational pot use? pic.twitter.com/q1mxLMWSf6  Emily C.

Alexandra Halaby (@iskandrah) February 23, 201771% of Americans don t want a crackdown on state marijuana laws. So what will the Trump admin do? Crack down on  em! https://t.co/aB9WB4QmZy https://t.co/9yNJb2uILn  Emily C. Singer (@CahnEmily) February 23, 2017According to 300 economists, including three Nobel laureates, if the government legalized marijuana it would save $7.7 billion annually. Let s look at Washington state where it garnered more than $250 million in marijuana sales in 2015. About $62 million of that constitutes marijuana excise taxes.Donald Trump did well in areas where many opiate overdoses and deaths occurred. The opioid crisis is real and deadly. That needs to be addressed so naturally, Republicans want to gut Obamacare, the health care law which has helped addicts get direly needed treatment. And Sean, marijuana is not an opioid, ya  big dummy. Chemical Dependency is called a disease because it s progressive, chronic and fatal. Marijuana is none of those things.Try not to take everyone s fun away, k?\",\n          \"Donald Trump is fuming after Fox New Sunday host Chris Wallace crushed his Environmental Protection Agency minion on the topic of climate change.As we all know, Trump is a climate change denier who thinks the whole thing is a scam created by the Chinese.So, of course, Trump chose a fellow climate change denier as his EPA Secretary.Scott Pruitt is an Oklahoma Republican who denies science, and during an interview on Fox, he found himself having to defend his anti-science views. Apparently, he hoped the interview would be a softball affair. But Chris Wallace repeatedly challenged him.Wallace began by slamming Pruitt s flawed logic that getting rid of President Obama s clean power plan will somehow improve air quality. You think that rewriting and, in fact, doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality, which you say is a major goal?  Wallace asked.Pruitt responded by claiming that President Obama was a tyrant who ruled through executive orders instead of letting Congress make the law.It should be pointed out that Donald Trump has signed 23 executive orders and he hasn t even served 100 days yet. He is on pace to sign 118 executive orders in his first year alone. President Obama only signed 276 over the course of eight years and signed less executive orders than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan.Trump could very well end up signing more executive orders than any of them. So, Pruitt can t seriously claim that Trump is following the  rule of law.  If anyone is ruling by  executive fiat,  it s Trump.Wallace then pointed out that Trump s deregulation of environmental protections has ceded the moral high ground to China in the fight against pollution and climate change.Pruitt didn t really give a damn. He said America has nothing to apologize for. We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the leadership we ve show as a country,  he claimed.Oh, but we do. Fighting climate change to save out planet will take international cooperation on a unprecedented scale. By withdrawing American leadership, Trump is sentencing the globe to disastrous climate change as if he thinks the United States is not part of the world and is somehow immune to what happens around us.Wallace proceeded to take on Pruitt s belief that humans are not responsible for climate change. Mr. Pruitt, there are all kinds of studies that contradict you,  Wallace noted.  The UN panel on climate change says it s 95 percent likely that at least half of the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that s all a coincidence? In response, Pruitt contradicted his own claim that he and Trump are working to improve air quality by insisting that the EPA should not be able to regulate greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.Wallace called Pruitt out an dropped the hammer on him. Sir, you re sugar coating what you have said. You said that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is, what if you re wrong? What if, in fact, the Earth is warming, what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Don t you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air, you don t think that plays a role? Pruitt answered by claiming that America burns coal cleanly, which is not true at all. There is no such thing as  clean coal,  and making such a claim is asinine.Here s the video via YouTube.According to Popular Mechanics,Coal will never be clean. It is possible to make coal emissions cleaner. In fact, we ve come a long way since the  70s in finding ways to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions, and more progress can be made. But the nut of the clean-coal sales pitch is that we can also bottle up the CO2 produced when coal is burned, most likely by burying it deep in the earth. That may be possible in theory, but it s devilishly difficult in practice.President Obama s clean power plan would have reduced carbon emissions more than they ever have been before. It was a crucial step toward fighting climate change and reducing America s role in causing it.But Donald Trump and his minions have reversed that progress and they are making things even worse. They are gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and have pulled America out the fight against climate change. So instead of moving forward, Trump is taking America backwards and that decision will have devastating results that Trump will personally experience once his Mar-a-Lago resort is under water because of sea level rise.Maybe when his precious golf club and resort is under water he ll admit that climate change is real. But by then, it will be too late.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"If you want to know how Trump treats the press, you need only read the White House press pool report from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s visit:The pool was then ushed into the Oval. POTUS and Benjamin Netanyahu sat in two chairs set up in front of the fireplace. FLOTUS sat on the couch to POTUS s right. Sara Netanyahu sat on the opposite couch. POTUS referred to the press as:  The nicest people over there. This remark was a clear attempt to soften up the people Trump usually demonizes as  fake news  and the  lying media.  In fact, the report says Trump even went out of his way to compliment  FAKE NEWS  CNN s Sarah Murray on a recent story. It was then that Murray, undeterred by The Donald s effort to win her over with a couple compliments, asked her question and all hell broke loose:He called out to CNN s Sara Murray and complimented a recent story. She asked POTUS to comment on whether his advisors contacted Russian intelligence officer during the campaign. *_Trump did not respond to her question._* Pool was asked to leave.This should have been an easy question for Trump. The answer is  yes.  Calls between key Trump staffers have not only been intercepted and made public by our own intelligence agencies and those of our allies who now have to spy on us because Trump is likely compromised. Michael Flynn just resigned because of his discussions of sanctions with the Russian ambassador while Obama was still President.Instead, Trump said nothing. No admission of wrongdoing, no promise to vet his people better or to actually do his f*cking duty to the American people, nothing.The terrifying thing is that Trump doesn t have to say anything.House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz   that s the guy who led the charge against Hillary Clinton  has already vowed that he will never satisfy their desire to bring down Donald Trump.  Rand Paul accidentally admitted that Republicans won t back a Trump investigation because they re too busy taking healthcare away from our country s most vulnerable. Besides, it s not like Trump is a Democrat, right? I just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,  Paul says.  We ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense. Think about that. Trump wasn t joking when he said he could shoot someone in public and not lose support   and he wasn t just talking about voters. At this point, we can pretty safely assume that our government is compromised to the point that he can literally get away with anything. You either have a country or you don t,  a small-handed orange man once said a few billion times. Call your congressmen. Demand they do the right thing and investigate and impeach Donald J. Trump now  while we still have a country.Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 566,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"July 2, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This from the party of states  rights. Just yesterday, Spicer said that transgender students  rights are a states  rights issue. Coincidentally, the states that have legalized recreational marijuana use voted largely for Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton. Hmm Spicer just compared recreational marijuana to the opioid crisis after an Arkansas reporter asked whether alleged President Donald Trump was OK with the state s medical marijuana law, rules for which were recently approved by the state s Medical Marijuana Commission.Spicer said the Department of Justice will be  taking action  against states that have legalized recreational marijuana.Spicer: DOJ will be  taking action  against states that have legalized recreational marijuana.  Radley Balko (@radleybalko) February 23, 2017Then this happened:Spicer said Trump approves of medical marijuana use   which could help provide relief to the chronically ill   as opposed to recreational use, which Spicer suggested was tied to the opioid crisis many states are currently facing.Watch:  There is still a federal law that we need to abide by   when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature,  Spicer said.This is going down really well on Twitter.So let s break down @seanspicer today: He says states should have the right to decide trans bathroom use, but not recreational pot use? pic.twitter.com/q1mxLMWSf6  Emily C.

Alexandra Halaby (@iskandrah) February 23, 201771% of Americans don t want a crackdown on state marijuana laws. So what will the Trump admin do? Crack down on  em! https://t.co/aB9WB4QmZy https://t.co/9yNJb2uILn  Emily C. Singer (@CahnEmily) February 23, 2017According to 300 economists, including three Nobel laureates, if the government legalized marijuana it would save $7.7 billion annually. Let s look at Washington state where it garnered more than $250 million in marijuana sales in 2015. About $62 million of that constitutes marijuana excise taxes.Donald Trump did well in areas where many opiate overdoses and deaths occurred. The opioid crisis is real and deadly. That needs to be addressed so naturally, Republicans want to gut Obamacare, the health care law which has helped addicts get direly needed treatment. And Sean, marijuana is not an opioid, ya  big dummy. Chemical Dependency is called a disease because it s progressive, chronic and fatal. Marijuana is none of those things.Try not to take everyone s fun away, k?\",\n          \"Donald Trump is fuming after Fox New Sunday host Chris Wallace crushed his Environmental Protection Agency minion on the topic of climate change.As we all know, Trump is a climate change denier who thinks the whole thing is a scam created by the Chinese.So, of course, Trump chose a fellow climate change denier as his EPA Secretary.Scott Pruitt is an Oklahoma Republican who denies science, and during an interview on Fox, he found himself having to defend his anti-science views. Apparently, he hoped the interview would be a softball affair. But Chris Wallace repeatedly challenged him.Wallace began by slamming Pruitt s flawed logic that getting rid of President Obama s clean power plan will somehow improve air quality. You think that rewriting and, in fact, doing away with the clean power plan is going to improve air quality, which you say is a major goal?  Wallace asked.Pruitt responded by claiming that President Obama was a tyrant who ruled through executive orders instead of letting Congress make the law.It should be pointed out that Donald Trump has signed 23 executive orders and he hasn t even served 100 days yet. He is on pace to sign 118 executive orders in his first year alone. President Obama only signed 276 over the course of eight years and signed less executive orders than Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Ronald Reagan.Trump could very well end up signing more executive orders than any of them. So, Pruitt can t seriously claim that Trump is following the  rule of law.  If anyone is ruling by  executive fiat,  it s Trump.Wallace then pointed out that Trump s deregulation of environmental protections has ceded the moral high ground to China in the fight against pollution and climate change.Pruitt didn t really give a damn. He said America has nothing to apologize for. We have nothing to be apologetic about with respect to the leadership we ve show as a country,  he claimed.Oh, but we do. Fighting climate change to save out planet will take international cooperation on a unprecedented scale. By withdrawing American leadership, Trump is sentencing the globe to disastrous climate change as if he thinks the United States is not part of the world and is somehow immune to what happens around us.Wallace proceeded to take on Pruitt s belief that humans are not responsible for climate change. Mr. Pruitt, there are all kinds of studies that contradict you,  Wallace noted.  The UN panel on climate change says it s 95 percent likely that at least half of the temperature increase since the mid-20th century is due to human activities. Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that s all a coincidence? In response, Pruitt contradicted his own claim that he and Trump are working to improve air quality by insisting that the EPA should not be able to regulate greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide.Wallace called Pruitt out an dropped the hammer on him. Sir, you re sugar coating what you have said. You said that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is, what if you re wrong? What if, in fact, the Earth is warming, what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Don t you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air, you don t think that plays a role? Pruitt answered by claiming that America burns coal cleanly, which is not true at all. There is no such thing as  clean coal,  and making such a claim is asinine.Here s the video via YouTube.According to Popular Mechanics,Coal will never be clean. It is possible to make coal emissions cleaner. In fact, we ve come a long way since the  70s in finding ways to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions, and more progress can be made. But the nut of the clean-coal sales pitch is that we can also bottle up the CO2 produced when coal is burned, most likely by burying it deep in the earth. That may be possible in theory, but it s devilishly difficult in practice.President Obama s clean power plan would have reduced carbon emissions more than they ever have been before. It was a crucial step toward fighting climate change and reducing America s role in causing it.But Donald Trump and his minions have reversed that progress and they are making things even worse. They are gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and have pulled America out the fight against climate change. So instead of moving forward, Trump is taking America backwards and that decision will have devastating results that Trump will personally experience once his Mar-a-Lago resort is under water because of sea level rise.Maybe when his precious golf club and resort is under water he ll admit that climate change is real. But by then, it will be too late.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"If you want to know how Trump treats the press, you need only read the White House press pool report from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s visit:The pool was then ushed into the Oval. POTUS and Benjamin Netanyahu sat in two chairs set up in front of the fireplace. FLOTUS sat on the couch to POTUS s right. Sara Netanyahu sat on the opposite couch. POTUS referred to the press as:  The nicest people over there. This remark was a clear attempt to soften up the people Trump usually demonizes as  fake news  and the  lying media.  In fact, the report says Trump even went out of his way to compliment  FAKE NEWS  CNN s Sarah Murray on a recent story. It was then that Murray, undeterred by The Donald s effort to win her over with a couple compliments, asked her question and all hell broke loose:He called out to CNN s Sara Murray and complimented a recent story. She asked POTUS to comment on whether his advisors contacted Russian intelligence officer during the campaign. *_Trump did not respond to her question._* Pool was asked to leave.This should have been an easy question for Trump. The answer is  yes.  Calls between key Trump staffers have not only been intercepted and made public by our own intelligence agencies and those of our allies who now have to spy on us because Trump is likely compromised. Michael Flynn just resigned because of his discussions of sanctions with the Russian ambassador while Obama was still President.Instead, Trump said nothing. No admission of wrongdoing, no promise to vet his people better or to actually do his f*cking duty to the American people, nothing.The terrifying thing is that Trump doesn t have to say anything.House Oversight Committee Jason Chaffetz   that s the guy who led the charge against Hillary Clinton  has already vowed that he will never satisfy their desire to bring down Donald Trump.  Rand Paul accidentally admitted that Republicans won t back a Trump investigation because they re too busy taking healthcare away from our country s most vulnerable. Besides, it s not like Trump is a Democrat, right? I just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,  Paul says.  We ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense. Think about that. Trump wasn t joking when he said he could shoot someone in public and not lose support   and he wasn t just talking about voters. At this point, we can pretty safely assume that our government is compromised to the point that he can literally get away with anything. You either have a country or you don t,  a small-handed orange man once said a few billion times. Call your congressmen. Demand they do the right thing and investigate and impeach Donald J. Trump now  while we still have a country.Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 566,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"July 2, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \\u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall.\\u201d Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren\\u2019s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules. \",\n          \"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced on Tuesday his veto of a $5 billion income tax rate hike that was the lynchpin of a newly passed bipartisan budget package designed to end the state\\u2019s record-setting fiscal impasse, he announced via social media. \\u201cI just vetoed Speaker Madigan\\u2019s 32 percent permanent income tax increase,\\u201d the Republican governor announced in posts to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, referring to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, the package\\u2019s main legislative architect.

This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 574,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"July 27, 2016\",\n          \"October 14, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \\u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall.\\u201d Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren\\u2019s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules. \",\n          \"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced on Tuesday his veto of a $5 billion income tax rate hike that was the lynchpin of a newly passed bipartisan budget package designed to end the state\\u2019s record-setting fiscal impasse, he announced via social media. \\u201cI just vetoed Speaker Madigan\\u2019s 32 percent permanent income tax increase,\\u201d the Republican governor announced in posts to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, referring to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, the package\\u2019s main legislative architect. The posts did not disclose whether he had taken similar action on spending and borrowing measures that made up the entire package. \",\n          \"Donald Trump s wife Melania, who became infamous for copying First Lady Michelle Obama s speech word for word at the Republican National Convention, recently gave yet another memorable speech this week. This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11953,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two faces of Maine politics show rifts in state Republican party (Reuters) - Maine\\u2019s two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the party\\u2019s stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maine\\u2019s reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their party\\u2019s leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. \\u201cWhat you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,\\u201d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePage\\u2019s Democratic challenger. \\u201cIs it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?\\u201d Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ideological tipping point,\\u201d said Dutson, who worked on Collins\\u2019 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. \\u201cIn the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,\\u201d Dutson said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.\\u201d Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governor\\u2019s. LePage was an early supporter of Trump\\u2019s White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was \\u201cnot a Susan Collins fan.\\u201d The chair of the state\\u2019s Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the party\\u2019s wide appeal in Maine. \\u201cWe\\u2019re an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but we\\u2019re a party, we\\u2019re a party of reform and we are going to stick together,\\u201d said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. \\u201cWe support both of them strongly.\\u201d The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesday\\u2019s decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the state\\u2019s next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. \\u201cI\\u2019m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I don\\u2019t veer either way,\\u201d LePage told WMOV radio. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s a collision to be had, it\\u2019s coming.\\u201d The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the state\\u2019s budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePage\\u2019s tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,\\u201d Bartlett said. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.\\u201d \",\n          \"Maine, New Jersey end state government shutdowns (Reuters) - New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public. Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state\\u2019s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies \\u201cFrom Here to Eternity\\u201d and \\u201cPlanet of the Apes.\\u201d Christie played down the kerfuffle. \\u201cIf they had flown that plane over the beach and I was sitting next to a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, that\\u2019s a story,\\u201d Christie said. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. Illinois is in its third year without an enacted budget. In Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them. Maine Governor Paul LePage announced on Twitter that he had signed a budget for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. \\u201cThe Maine state government shutdown is now over. Happy Fourth of July!\\u201d LePage said. \\u201cI have signed a budget with no tax increase. I thank the House Republicans for standing strong for the Maine people,\\u201d he said in a second tweet.Maine state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue had all planned to work through the shutdown, the state\\u2019s first since 1991. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’s Eve Message; This is Disturbing Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that. Instead, he had to give a shout out to his enemies, haters and  the very dishonest fake news media.  The former reality show star had just one job to do and he couldn t do it. As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year,  President Angry Pants tweeted.  2018 will be a great year for America! As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017Trump s tweet went down about as welll as you d expect.What kind of president sends a New Year s greeting like this despicable, petty, infantile gibberish? Only Trump! His lack of decency won t even allow him to rise above the gutter long enough to wish the American citizens a happy new year!  Bishop Talbert Swan (@TalbertSwan) December 31, 2017no one likes you  Calvin (@calvinstowell) December 31, 2017Your impeachment would make 2018 a great year for America, but I ll also accept regaining control of Congress.  Miranda Yaver (@mirandayaver) December 31, 2017Do you hear yourself talk? When you have to include that many people that hate you you have to wonder? Why do the they all hate me?  Alan Sandoval (@AlanSandoval13) December 31, 2017Who uses the word Haters in a New Years wish??  Marlene (@marlene399) December 31, 2017You can t just say happy new year?  Koren pollitt (@Korencarpenter) December 31, 2017Here s Trump s New Year s Eve tweet from 2016.Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do. Love!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016This is nothing new for Trump. He s been doing this for years.Trump has directed messages to his  enemies  and  haters  for New Year s, Easter, Thanksgiving, and the anniversary of 9/11. pic.twitter.com/4FPAe2KypA  Daniel Dale (@ddale8) December 31, 2017Trump s holiday tweets are clearly not presidential.How long did he work at Hallmark before becoming President?  Steven Goodine (@SGoodine) December 31, 2017He s always been like this . . . the only difference is that in the last few years, his filter has been breaking down.  Roy Schulze (@thbthttt) December 31, 2017Who, apart from a teenager uses the term haters?  Wendy (@WendyWhistles) December 31, 2017he s a fucking 5 year old  Who Knows (@rainyday80) December 31, 2017So, to all the people who voted for this a hole thinking he would change once he got into power, you were wrong! 70-year-old men don t change and now he s a year older.Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.'"

Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \\u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall.\\u201d Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren\\u2019s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules. \",\n          \"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced on Tuesday his veto of a $5 billion income tax rate hike that was the lynchpin of a newly passed bipartisan budget package designed to end the state\\u2019s record-setting fiscal impasse, he announced via social media. \\u201cI just vetoed Speaker Madigan\\u2019s 32 percent permanent income tax increase,\\u201d the Republican governor announced in posts to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, referring to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, the package\\u2019s main legislative architect. The posts did not disclose whether he had taken similar action on spending and borrowing measures that made up the entire package. \",\n          \"Donald Trump s wife Melania, who became infamous for copying First Lady Michelle Obama s speech word for word at the Republican National Convention, recently gave yet another memorable speech this week. This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11953,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two faces of Maine politics show rifts in state Republican party (Reuters) - Maine\\u2019s two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the party\\u2019s stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maine\\u2019s reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their party\\u2019s leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. \\u201cWhat you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,\\u201d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePage\\u2019s Democratic challenger. \\u201cIs it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?\\u201d Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ideological tipping point,\\u201d said Dutson, who worked on Collins\\u2019 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. \\u201cIn the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,\\u201d Dutson said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.\\u201d Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governor\\u2019s. LePage was an early supporter of Trump\\u2019s White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was \\u201cnot a Susan Collins fan.\\u201d The chair of the state\\u2019s Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the party\\u2019s wide appeal in Maine. \\u201cWe\\u2019re an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but we\\u2019re a party, we\\u2019re a party of reform and we are going to stick together,\\u201d said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. \\u201cWe support both of them strongly.\\u201d The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesday\\u2019s decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the state\\u2019s next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. \\u201cI\\u2019m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I don\\u2019t veer either way,\\u201d LePage told WMOV radio. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s a collision to be had, it\\u2019s coming.\\u201d The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the state\\u2019s budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePage\\u2019s tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,\\u201d Bartlett said. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.\\u201d \",\n          \"Maine, New Jersey end state government shutdowns (Reuters) - New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public. Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state\\u2019s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies \\u201cFrom Here to Eternity\\u201d and \\u201cPlanet of the Apes.\\u201d Christie played down the kerfuffle. \\u201cIf they had flown that plane over the beach and I was sitting next to a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, that\\u2019s a story,\\u201d Christie said. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. Illinois is in its third year without an enacted budget. In Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them. Maine Governor Paul LePage announced on Twitter that he had signed a budget for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. \\u201cThe Maine state government shutdown is now over. Happy Fourth of July!\\u201d LePage said. \\u201cI have signed a budget with no tax increase. I thank the House Republicans for standing strong for the Maine people,\\u201d he said in a second tweet.Maine state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue had all planned to work through the shutdown, the state\\u2019s first since 1991. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \\u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall.\\u201d Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren\\u2019s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules. \",\n          \"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced on Tuesday his veto of a $5 billion income tax rate hike that was the lynchpin of a newly passed bipartisan budget package designed to end the state\\u2019s record-setting fiscal impasse, he announced via social media. \\u201cI just vetoed Speaker Madigan\\u2019s 32 percent permanent income tax increase,\\u201d the Republican governor announced in posts to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, referring to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, the package\\u2019s main legislative architect.

This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11953,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two faces of Maine politics show rifts in state Republican party (Reuters) - Maine\\u2019s two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the party\\u2019s stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maine\\u2019s reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their party\\u2019s leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. \\u201cWhat you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,\\u201d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePage\\u2019s Democratic challenger. \\u201cIs it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?\\u201d Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ideological tipping point,\\u201d said Dutson, who worked on Collins\\u2019 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. \\u201cIn the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,\\u201d Dutson said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.\\u201d Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governor\\u2019s. LePage was an early supporter of Trump\\u2019s White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was \\u201cnot a Susan Collins fan.\\u201d The chair of the state\\u2019s Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the party\\u2019s wide appeal in Maine. \\u201cWe\\u2019re an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but we\\u2019re a party, we\\u2019re a party of reform and we are going to stick together,\\u201d said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. \\u201cWe support both of them strongly.\\u201d The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesday\\u2019s decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the state\\u2019s next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. \\u201cI\\u2019m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I don\\u2019t veer either way,\\u201d LePage told WMOV radio. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s a collision to be had, it\\u2019s coming.\\u201d The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the state\\u2019s budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePage\\u2019s tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,\\u201d Bartlett said. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.\\u201d \",\n          \"Maine, New Jersey end state government shutdowns (Reuters) - New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public. Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state\\u2019s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies \\u201cFrom Here to Eternity\\u201d and \\u201cPlanet of the Apes.\\u201d Christie played down the kerfuffle. \\u201cIf they had flown that plane over the beach and I was sitting next to a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, that\\u2019s a story,\\u201d Christie said. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. Illinois is in its third year without an enacted budget. In Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them. Maine Governor Paul LePage announced on Twitter that he had signed a budget for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. \\u201cThe Maine state government shutdown is now over. Happy Fourth of July!\\u201d LePage said. \\u201cI have signed a budget with no tax increase. I thank the House Republicans for standing strong for the Maine people,\\u201d he said in a second tweet.Maine state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue had all planned to work through the shutdown, the state\\u2019s first since 1991. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_joined\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11950,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"factbox trump adviser wall street backs bank breakups washington reuters goldman sachs group executive white house adviser gary cohn shocked wall street colleagues week showed support reinstating depression break biggest banks details called glass steagall returned spotlight glass steagall originally passed banking glass steagall established firewall commercial investment banking activity whittled away time banks gained permission engage trading activity repealed altogether gramm leach bliley supports financial crisis glass steagall calling card politicians eager crack wall street democratic senator elizabeth warren frequently invokes senator bernie sanders major presidential campaign president donald trump seized policy campaign white house trump administration backed away campaign stance questions aggressively president push issue tends come officials asked treasury secretary steven mnuchin said supported modern version glass steagall response question confirmation hearing white house press secretary sean spicer said white house supports proposal asked reporters cohn responded favorably asked warren private meeting senators glass steagall look like number ideas create refer century glass steagall warren proposed splitting commercial investment banking barring depository institutions modern financial instruments like derivatives thomas hoenig vice chair federal deposit insurance corporation proposed similar split banks higher percent capital requirement neel kashkari president federal reserve bank minneapolis force banks capital prefer split smaller institutions happen wall street critics seized glass steagall efforts change garnered little support warren proposal received handful legislative sponsors congress white house consumed complex fights health care reform little appetite broad controversial overhaul financial risks banks lenders including jpmorgan chase bank america corp citigroup impacted commercial lending investment banking operations closely intertwined analysts goldman sachs group morgan stanley impacted likely revert standalone investment banks shed deposit funding glass steagall industry spend money time energy lobbying idea focus rolling existing rules\",\n          \"illinois governor announces veto billion hike chicago reuters illinois governor bruce rauner announced tuesday veto billion income rate hike lynchpin newly passed bipartisan budget package designed state record setting fiscal impasse announced social media vetoed speaker madigan percent permanent income increase republican governor announced posts facebook twitter accounts referring democratic house speaker michael madigan package main legislative architect posts disclose taken similar action spending borrowing measures entire package\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Here are some details about the law, called the Glass-Steagall Act, and why it has returned to the spotlight: WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL: Originally passed as part of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity. The law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity, and was repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. WHO SUPPORTS IT?: Since the 2008 financial crisis, Glass-Steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on Wall Street. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it, and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign. President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign. WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY?: The Trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance, but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law. The issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House supports the proposal when asked by reporters. Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senators. WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE?: There are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a \\u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall.\\u201d Warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking, and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives. Thomas Hoenig, the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has proposed a similar split, and would subject banks to a higher, 10 percent capital requirement. Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions. COULD IT HAPPEN?: Although many Wall Street critics have seized on Glass-Steagall, efforts to change the law have garnered very little support. Warren\\u2019s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors. And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform, there seems to be little appetite for a broad, controversial overhaul of the financial system. ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS?: Big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) would be most impacted, because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined, say analysts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) might be less impacted, although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding. But even if Glass-Steagall does not become law, the industry may have to spend money, time and energy lobbying against the idea, when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules. \",\n          \"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner announced on Tuesday his veto of a $5 billion income tax rate hike that was the lynchpin of a newly passed bipartisan budget package designed to end the state\\u2019s record-setting fiscal impasse, he announced via social media. \\u201cI just vetoed Speaker Madigan\\u2019s 32 percent permanent income tax increase,\\u201d the Republican governor announced in posts to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, referring to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, the package\\u2019s main legislative architect.

This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politicsNews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"isfake\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"original\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11953,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two faces of Maine politics show rifts in state Republican party (Reuters) - Maine\\u2019s two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the party\\u2019s stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maine\\u2019s reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their party\\u2019s leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote. \\u201cWhat you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,\\u201d said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePage\\u2019s Democratic challenger. \\u201cIs it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?\\u201d Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an ideological tipping point,\\u201d said Dutson, who worked on Collins\\u2019 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans. \\u201cIn the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,\\u201d Dutson said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.\\u201d Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governor\\u2019s. LePage was an early supporter of Trump\\u2019s White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was \\u201cnot a Susan Collins fan.\\u201d The chair of the state\\u2019s Republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two, saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the party\\u2019s wide appeal in Maine. \\u201cWe\\u2019re an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but we\\u2019re a party, we\\u2019re a party of reform and we are going to stick together,\\u201d said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January. \\u201cWe support both of them strongly.\\u201d The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had \\u201cserious concerns\\u201d about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesday\\u2019s decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the state\\u2019s next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion. \\u201cI\\u2019m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I don\\u2019t veer either way,\\u201d LePage told WMOV radio. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s a collision to be had, it\\u2019s coming.\\u201d The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the state\\u2019s budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePage\\u2019s tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,\\u201d Bartlett said. \\u201cBut we\\u2019re now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.\\u201d \",\n          \"Maine, New Jersey end state government shutdowns (Reuters) - New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public. Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state\\u2019s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies \\u201cFrom Here to Eternity\\u201d and \\u201cPlanet of the Apes.\\u201d Christie played down the kerfuffle. \\u201cIf they had flown that plane over the beach and I was sitting next to a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, that\\u2019s a story,\\u201d Christie said. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. Illinois is in its third year without an enacted budget. In Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them.

        "input_text = \"In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images\"\n",
